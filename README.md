# Blue_android_app
The App designed to complete my [vocal assistant for desktop](https://www.github.com/thaaoblues/blue)

## Features :
  - Can be used as microphone for the vocal assistant
  - Have an offline (more of an off-base-assistant mode) mode with some similar features (a bit stripped)
  - Have a bubble widget floating on screen (like facebook messenger) to ease the voice recon access
  - send url to display a website on the main screen of the vocal assistant
